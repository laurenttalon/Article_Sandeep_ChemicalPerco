	is obtained downstream the injector. The core radius RI and the Reynolds
	number Re of the so-obtained base state are varied independently
	due to the control of the flow rate of each fluid. However, a downstream
	destabilization of this base state was observed within the explored
	range of the two control parameters RI and Re. Moreover, the fixed
	location of this destabilization, observed for some particular parameters,
	suggests an absolute nature of the instability. We present a tentative
	delineation of the nature (convective or absolute) of the instability
	and discuss the accessible measurements to experimentally address
	this issue.},

  journal = {Science},
  year = {1966},
  volume = {153},
  pages = {708-716},
  number = {3737},
  abstract = {Motile Escherichia coli placed at one end of a capillary tube containing
	an energy source and oxygen migrate out into the tube in one or two
	bands, which are clearly visible to the naked eye and can also be
	demonstrated by photography, microscopy, and densitometry and by
	assaying for bacteria throughout the tube. The formation of two bands
	is not due to heterogeneity among the bacteria, since the bacteria
	in each band, when reused, will form two more bands.If an anaerobically
	utilizable energy source such as galactose is present in excess over
	the oxygen, the first band consumes all the oxygen and a part of
	the sugar and the second band uses the residual sugar anaerobically.
	On the other hand, if oxygen is present in excess over the sugar,
	the first band oxidizes all the sugar and leaves behind unused oxygen,
	and the second band uses up the residual oxygen to oxidize an endogenous
	energy source.The essence of the matter is that the bacteria create
	a gradient of oxygen or of an energy source, and then they move preferentially
	in the direction of the higher concentration of the chemical. As
	a consequence, bands of bacteria (or rings of bacteria in the case
	of agar plates) form and move out. These results show that E. coli
	is chemotactic toward oxygen and energy sources such as galactose,
	glucose, aspartic acid, threonine, or serine. The full repertoire
	of chemotactic responses by E. coli is no doubt greater than this,
	and a more complete list remains to be compiled.The studies reported
	here demonstrate that chemotaxis allows bacteria to find that environment
	which provides them with the greatest supply of energy. It is clearly
	an advantage for bacteria to be able to carry out chemotaxis, since
	by this means they can avoid unfavorable conditions and seek optimum
	surroundings.Finally, it is necessary to acknowledge the pioneering
	work of Englemann, Pfeffer, and the other late-19thcentury biologists
	who discovered chemotaxis in bacteria, and to point out that the
	studies reported here fully confirm the earlier reports of Beijerinck
	(4) and Sherris and his collaborators (5,6) on a band of bacteria
	chemotactic toward oxygen. By using a chemically defined medium instead
	of a complex broth, it has been possible to study this band more
	closely and to demonstrate in addition the occurrence of a second
	band of bacteria chemotactic toward an energy source. Beijerinck
	(4) did, in fact, sometimes observe a second band, but he did not
	offer an explanation for it.},

  abstract = { The physics of liquids in porous media gives rise to many interesting
	phenomena, including imbibition where a viscous fluid displaces a
	less viscous one. Here we discuss the theoretical and experimental
	progress made in recent years in this field. The emphasis is on an
	interfacial description, akin to the focus of a statistical physics
	approach. Coarse-grained equations of motion have been recently presented
	in the literature. These contain terms that take into account the
	pertinent features of imbibition: non-locality and the quenched noise
	that arises from the random environment, fluctuations of the fluid
	flow and capillary forces. The theoretical progress has highlighted
	the presence of intrinsic length-scales that invalidate scale invariance
	often assumed to be present in kinetic roughening processes such
	as that of a two-phase boundary in liquid penetration. Another important
	fact is that the macroscopic fluid flow, the kinetic roughening properties,
	and the effective noise in the problem are all coupled. Many possible
	deviations from simple scaling behaviour exist, and we outline the
	experimental evidence. Finally, prospects for further work, both
	theoretical and experimental, are discussed. },

  journal = {Eur. J. Mech. B-Fluids},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {19},
  pages = {229--252},
  abstract = {Instabilities in two-layer Couette flow are investigated from a small
	Reynolds number expansion of the eigenvalue problem governing linear
	stability. The wave velocity and growth rate are given explicitly,
	and previous results for long waves and short waves are retrieved
	as special cases. In addition to the inertial instability due to
	viscous stratification, the flow may be subject to the Rayleigh­Taylor
	instability. As a result of the competition of these two instabilities,
	inertia may completely stabilise a gravity-unstable flow above some
	finite critical Froude number, or conversely, for a gravitystable
	flow, inertia may give rise to finite wavenumber instability above
	some finite critical Weber number. General conditions for these phenomena
	are given, as well as exact or approximate values of the critical
	numbers. The validity domain of the many asymptotic expansions is
	then investigated from comparison with the numerical solution. It
	appears that the small-Re expansion gives good results beyond Re
	= 1, with an error less that 1\%. For Reynolds numbers of a few hundred,
	we show from the eigenfunctions and the energy equation that the
	nature of the instability changes: instability still arises from
	the interfacial mode (there is no mode crossing), but this mode takes
	all the features of a shear mode. The other modes correspond to the
	stable eigenmodes of the single-layer Couette flow, which are recovered
	when one fluid is rigidified by increasing its viscosity or surface
	tension.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of the water?oil front for two-phase, immiscible
	flow in heterogeneous porous media. Our analysis takes into account
	the viscous coupling between the pressure field and the saturation
	map. Although most of previously published stochastic homogenization
	approaches for upscaling two-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media
	neglect this viscous coupling, we show that it plays a crucial role
	on the dynamics of the front. In particular, when the mobility ratio
	is favorable, the viscous coupling induces a transverse flux that
	stabilizes the water?oil front, which follows a stationary behavior,
	at least in a statistical sense. Calculations are based on a double
	perturbation expansion of equations at first order: the local velocity
	fluctuation is defined as the sum of a viscous term related to perturbations
	of the saturation map, on one hand, plus the perturbation induced
	by the heterogeneity of the permeability field with a base-state
	saturation map, on the other hand. In this first paper, we focus
	on flows in stratified reservoirs, with stratification parallel to
	the mean flow. Our results allow to predict the evolution of large
	Fourier mode of the front, and the emergence of a stationary front,
	for favorable mobility ratios. Numerical experiments confirm our
	predictions. Our approach is applied to downscaling. Extension of
	our theory to isotropic media is presented in the companion paper.},

	Two different mechanisms of interface deformation are described:
	(i) purely thermal features due to convection inside each layer independently
	can locally and partially deform the interface, leading to dynamic
	topography; (ii) when the effective buoyancy number (the ratio of
	the stabilizing chemical density anomaly to the destabilizing thermal
	density anomaly) reaches a critical value, a whole-layer regime takes
	place, where the system is fully destabilized and one of the two
	layers invades the other one in the form of large domes. Several
	successive pulsations can be observed provided the viscosity ratio
	is large enough (i.e. ${>}\,5$). Typical scales (time, length, temperature
	excess, velocity) and behaviours (direction of spouting, shapes)
	are determined for each case. Both features are only transient states:
	because of stirring, the system systematically evolves towards one-layer
	Rayleigh?B{\'e}nard convection. However, this transient state can

  number = {01},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT The classical theory of Brownian motion applies to suspensions
	which are so dilute that each particle is effectively alone in infinite
	fluid. We consider here the modifications to the theory that are
	needed when rigid spherical particles are close enough to interact
	hydrodynamically. It is first shown that Brownian motion is a diffusion
	process of the conventional kind provided that the particle configuration
	does not change significantly during a viscous relaxation time. The
	original argument due to Einstein, which invokes an equilibrium situation,
	is generalized to show that the particle flux in probability space
	due to Brownian motion is the same as that which would be produced
	by the application of a certain &lsquo;thermodynamic&rsquo; force
	to each particle. We then use this prescription to deduce the Brownian
	diffusivities in two different types of situation. The first concerns
	a dilute homogeneous suspension which is being deformed, and the
	relative translational diffusivity of two rigid spherical particles
	with a given separation is calculated from the properties of the
	low-Reynolds-number flow due to two spheres moving under equal and
	opposite forces. The second concerns a suspension in which there
	is a gradient of concentration of particles. The thermodynamic force
	on each particle in this case is shown to be equal to the gradient
	of the chemical potential of the particles, which brings considerations
	of the multi-particle excluded volume into the problem. Determination
	of the particle flux due to the action of this force is equivalent
	to determination of the sedimentation velocity of particles falling
	through fluid under gravity, for which a theoretical result correct
	to the first order in volume fraction of the particles is available.
	The diffusivity of the particles is found to increase slowly as the
	concentration rises from zero. These results are generalized to the
	case of a (dilute) inhomogeneous suspension of several different
	species of spherical particle, and expressions are obtained for the
	diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the diffusivity matrix. Numerical
	values of all the relevant hydrodynamic functions are given for the
	case of spheres of uniform size.},

	according to a log-Gaussian distribution with variance and correlation
	length depending on the window size and the porous microstructure.
	Finally, we apply the procedure to an anisotropic regular network
	for which an analytical solution can be found and show that using

	The resulting front between the two fluids spreads as the square

	viscosity, and geometrical configuration of the current. On the other
	hand, an autocatalytic reaction front between a reactant and a product
	may propagate as a solitary wave, namely, at a constant velocity
	and with a stationary concentration profile, resulting from the balance
	between molecular diffusion and chemical reaction. In most systems,
	the fluid left behind the front has a different density leading to
	a lock-exchange configuration. We revisit, with a chemical reaction,
	the classical situation of lock-exchange. We present an experimental
	analysis of buoyancy effects on the shape and the velocity of the
	iodate arsenous acid autocatalytic reaction fronts, propagating in
	horizontal rectangular channels and for a wide range of aspect ratios
	(1/3 to 20) and cylindrical tubes. We do observe stationary-shaped

  abstract = {A detailed two-part computational investigation is conducted into
	the dynamical evolution of two-dimensional miscible porous media
	flows in the quarter five-spot arrangement of injection and production
	wells. High-accuary direct numerical simulations are performed that
	reproduce all dynamically relevant length scales in solving the vorticity­streamfunction
	formulation of Darcy's law. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated
	by a comparison of simulation data with linear stability results
	for radial source flow. Within this part, Part 1 of the present investigation,
	a series of simulations is discussed that demonstrate how the mobility
	ratio and the dimensionless flow rate denoted by the P? clet number
	P e affect both local and integral features of homogeneous e displacement
	processes. Mobility ratios up to 150 and P e-values up to 2000 are
	investigated. For sufficiently large P e-values, the flow near the
	injection well gives rise to a vigorous viscous fingering instability.
	As the unstable concentration front approaches the central region
	of the domain, nonlinear interactions between the fingers similar
	to those known from unidirectional flows are observed, such as merging,
	partial merging, and shielding, along with secondary tip-splitting
	and side-branching instabilities. At large P e-values, several of
	these fingers compete for long times, before one of them accelerates
	ahead of the others and leads to the breakthrough of the front. In
	contrast to unidirectional flows, the quarter five-spot geometry
	imposes both an external length scale and a time scale on the flow.
	The resulting spatial non-uniformity of the potential base flow is
	observed to lead to a clear separation in space and time of large
	and small scales in the flow. Small scales occur predominantly during
	the early stages near the injection well, and at late times near
	the production well. The central domain is dominated by larger scales.
	Taken together, the results of the simulations demonstrate that both
	the mobility ratio and P e strongly affect the dynamics of the flow.
	While some integral measures, such as the recovery at breakthrough,
	may show only a weak dependence on P e for large P e-values, the
	local fingering dynamics continue to change with P e. The increased
	susceptibility of the flow to perturbations during the early stages
	provides the motivation to formulate an optimization problem that
	attempts to maximize recovery, for a constant overall process time,
	by employing a time-dependent flow rate. Within the present framework,
	which accounts for molecular diffusion but not for velocity-dependent
	dispersion, simulation results indeed indicate the potential to increase
	recovery by reducing the flow rate at early times, and then increasing
	it during the later stages.},

	inhomogeneities are seen to have a strong effect on the flow, which
	can result in a complete bypass of the linear growth phase of the
	viscous fingering instability. In contrast to their homogeneous counterparts
	(cf. Part 1, Chen {\&} Meiburg 1998), heterogeneous quarter five-spot
	flows are seen to exhibit a more uniform dominant length scale throughout
	the entire flow domain. In line with earlier findings for unidirectional
	displacements, an optimal interaction of the mobility and permeability
	related vorticity modes can occur when the viscous length scale is
	of the same order as the correlation length of the heterogeneities.
	This resonance mechanism results in a minimal breakthrough recovery
	for intermediate correlation lengths, at fixed dimensionless flow
	rates in the form of a P? clet number e P e. However, for a constant
	correlation length, the recovery does not show a minimum as P e is
	varied. Confirming earlier observations, the simulations show a more
	rapid breakthrough as the variance of the permeability variations
	increases. However, this tendency is far more noticeable in some
	parameter regimes than in others. It is furthermore observed that
	relatively low variances usually cannot change the tendency for a
	dominant finger to evolve along the inherently preferred diagonal
	direction, especially for relatively small correlation lengths. Only
	for higher variances, and for larger correlation lengths, are situations
	observed in which an off-diagonal finger can become dominant. Due
	to the nonlinear nature of the selection mechanisms at work, a change
	in the variance of the heterogeneities can result in the formation

  abstract = {Numerical simulation results are presented for the displacement of
	a drop in a porous medium. The drop is surrounded by a more viscous
	fluid with which it is fully miscible. The simulations are based
	on a set of augmented Hele­Shaw equations that account for nonconventional,
	so-called Korteweg stresses resulting from locally steep concentration
	gradients. Globally, these stresses tend to stabilize the displacement.
	However, there are important distinctions between their action and
	the effects of surface tension in an immiscible flow. Since the Korteweg
	stresses depend on the concentration gradient field, the effective
	net force across the miscible interface region is not just a function
	of the drop's geometry, but also of the velocity gradient tensor.
	Locally high strain at the leading edge of the drop generates steep
	concentration gradients and large Korteweg stresses. Around the rear
	of the drop, the diffusion layer is much thicker and the related
	stresses smaller. The drop is seen to form a tail, which can be explained
	based on a pressure balance argument similar to the one invoked to
	explain tail formation in Hele­Shaw flows with surfactant. The dependence
	of such flows on the Peclet number is complex, as steeper concentration
	gradients amplify the growth of the viscous fingering instability,
	while simultaneously generating larger stabilizing Korteweg forces.},

  title = {Global instabilities in spatially developing flows: Non-Normality
	and Nonlinearity},
  journal = {Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.},
  year = {2005},
  abstract = {The objective of this review is to critically assess the different
	approaches developed in recent years to understand the dynamics of
	open flows such as mixing layers, jets, wakes, separation bubbles,
	boundary layers, and so on. These complex flows develop in extended
	domains in which fluid particles are continuously advected downstream.
	They behave either as noise amplifiers or as oscillators, both of
	which exhibit strong nonlinearities (Huerre {\&} Monkewitz 1990).
	The local approach is inherently weakly nonparallel and it assumes
	that the basic flow varies on a long length scale compared to the
	wavelength of the instability waves. The dynamics of the flow is
	then considered as a superposition of linear or nonlinear instability
	waves that, at leading order, behave at each streamwise station as
	if the flow were homogeneous in the streamwise direction. In the
	fully global context, the basic flow and the instabilities do not
	have to be characterized by widely separated length scales, and the
	dynamics is then viewed as the result of the interactions between
	Global modes living in the entire physical domain with the streamwise
	direction as an eigendirection. This second approach is more and
	more resorted to as a result of increased computational capability.
	The earlier review of Huerre {\&} Monkewitz (1990) emphasized how
	local linear theory can account for the noise amplifier behavior
	as well as for the onset of a Global mode. The present survey first
	adopts the opposite point of view by demonstrating how fully global
	theory accounts for the noise amplifier behavior of open flows. From
	such a perspective, there is strong emphasis on the very peculiar
	nonorthogonality of linear Global modes, which in turn allows a novel
	interpretation of recent numerical simulations and experimental observations.
	The nonorthogonality of linear Global modes also imposes severe constraints
	on the extension of linear global theory to the fully nonlinear r?
	gime. When the flow is weakly nonpare allel, this limitation is so
	severe that the linear Global mode theory is of little help. It is
	then much more appropriate to develop a fully nonlinear formulation
	involving the presence of a front separating the base state region
	from the bifurcated state region.},

	density stratification can lead to Rayleigh?Taylor or Rayleigh?B{\'e}nard

	destabilize the front because of the double-diffusive phenomena.
	We compare the stability boundaries for the classical hydrodynamic
	case of a bounded layer without reaction and for the chemical front
	in the parameter space spanned by the thermal and solutal Rayleigh
	numbers. We show that chemical reactions profoundly affect the stability

	reactive case, a linear stability analysis identifies three distinct

	the classical double-diffusive layer. In particular a region of global
	and local stable stratification is susceptible to a counter-intuitive
	mechanism of convective instability driven by chemistry and double-diffusion.
	The other two regions display an additional contribution of localized

	affect the density fingering leading to changes in the characteristic

	finger of stationary shape traveling with constant nonlinear speed
	V>v and mixing zone W>w. This is drastically different from pure
	density fingering for which fingers elongate monotonically in time.
	The asymptotic finger has axial and transverse averaged profiles

	find that W/Ra scales as Da?0.5. For larger Ra, tip splittings are

	The only assumption is that the spatially varying permeability K(Y)

	formula as being an upper bound for Keff. For anisotropic systems,

	Computational fuel cell engineering (CFCE) tools that allow systematic

	the integration of such advances, allow less heavy reliance on hardware

	well understood, array of phenomena involving fluidic, ionic, electronic

	In this paper, we report on some progress in both fundamental modelling
	of these phenomena, as well as in the development of integrated,

	are twofold: first to give theoretical tools to study the existing
	link-type boundary conditions and their corresponding accuracy; second
	to design boundary conditions for general flows which are third-order
	kinetic accurate. Using these new boundary conditions, Couette and
	Poiseuille flows are exact solutions of the lattice Boltzmann models
	for a Reynolds number Re=0 (Stokes limit) for arbitrary inclination
	with the lattice directions. Numerical comparisons are given for
	Stokes flows in periodic arrays of spheres and cylinders, linear
	periodic array of cylinders between moving plates, and for Navier-Stokes
	flows in periodic arrays of cylinders for Re<200. These results show
	a significant improvement of the overall accuracy when using the
	linear interpolations instead of the bounce-back reflection (up to
	an order of magnitude on the hydrodynamics fields). Further improvement
	is achieved with the new multireflection boundary conditions, reaching
	a level of accuracy close to the quasianalytical reference solutions,
	even for rather modest grid resolutions and few points in the narrowest
	channels. More important, the pressure and velocity fields in the
	vicinity of the obstacles are much smoother with multireflection

	of these schemes is highlighted by some simulations of moving obstacles:

	Quite remarkably, the OTRT stability bounds are the same for any
	Peclet number and they are defined by the adjustable equilibrium
	parameters. Such optimal stability is reached owing to the free (
	kinetic ) relaxation parameter. Furthermore, the sufficient stability
	bounds tolerate negative equilibrium functions (the distribution
	divided by the local mass), often labeled as unphysical . We prove
	that the non-negativity condition is (i) a sufficient stability condition
	of the TRT model with any eigenvalues for the pure diffusion equation,
	(ii) a sufficient stability condition of its OTRT and BGK/SRT sub-classes,
	for any linear anisotropic advection-diffusion equation, and (iii)
	unnecessarily more restrictive for any Peclet number than the optimal
	sufficient conditions. Adequate choices of the two relaxation rates
	and the free-tunable equilibrium parameters make the OTRT sub-class
	more efficient than the BGK one, at least in the advection-dominant
	regime, and allow larger time steps than known criteria of the forward
	time central finite-difference schemes (FTCS/MFTCS) for both, advection
	and diffusion dominant regimes.},

  abstract = {An unexpected statement that sharply contradicts generally accepted
	opinion is usually called a ''paradox.'' By this definition, the
	concept of paradox belongs to the field of logic. Logical paradoxes
	are knownfrom ancient times. However,in modern science, not only
	deductions but also physical phenomena frequently represented as
	paradoxical. Such unexare pected physical situations contradicting
	orthodox intuition are called ''effects.'' Hydrodynamics is a science
	in which there are many paradoxes and effects that are of fundamental
	importance. Birkhoff (1950) was the first to study the role of paradoxes
	and to classify them. The Euler-d'Alembert paradox, in which a body
	has no drag force in a potential stream, is historically the first.
	Considerably later it wasrevealed that the paradox is related to
	idealization of the flow pattern, which in reality, first, is by
	no meanspotential; second, is not steady; and third, is characterized
	by viscosity that, though small, is capable of playing a cardinal
	role. Thus the Euler-d'Alembert paradox is associated with oversimplification
	of the model; such paradoxes are numerous. Since the time of Prandtl,
	whocreated the theory of the boundarylayer, the opinion has becomegenerally
	widespread that taking account of viscosity removesall paradoxes.
	According to Ladyzhenskaya (1969), ''the mathematical model of viscous
	fluid governed by the basic Navier-Stokes equations.., had to serve
	as a scapegoat, answering for all the accumulatedabsurdities of the
	theory of ideal fluids, as well as accountingfor the lifting force,
	the drag, the turbulent-wake, and many other things.'' But according
	to Ladyzhenskaya the scapegoat does not overcome the problem, since
	in the theory of a viscous fluid its ownparadoxes have appeared.
	The Stokes paradox is the best-known example. It concerns the problem},

	of two miscible fluids in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell is investigated

	presented for different Rayleigh numbers, viscosity ratios and interfacial
	thickness parameters of the base concentration profile. The analysis
	employs the three-dimensional Stokes equations, and the results are
	compared with those obtained from the variable density and viscosity
	Hele-Shaw equations. While the growth rate does not depend on which
	of the two fluids is the more viscous, the maxima of the eigenfunctions
	are always seen to shift towards the less viscous fluid. For every
	parameter combination, the dominant instability mode is found to
	be three-dimensional. With increasing viscosity ratio, the instability
	is uniformly damped. For a fixed viscosity ratio, both the growth
	rate and the most unstable wavenumber increase monotonically with
	the Rayleigh number, until they asymptotically reach a plateau. Surprising
	findings are obtained regarding the effects of varying the interface
	thickness. At higher viscosity ratios the largest growth rates and
	unstable wavenumbers are observed for intermediate thicknesses. This
	demonstrates that for variable viscosities thicker interfaces can
	be more unstable than their thinner counterparts, in contrast to
	the constant viscosity case. The reason behind this behaviour can
	be traced to the influence of the gap width on the vertical extent
	of the perturbation eigenfunctions. For thick interfaces, the eigenfunction
	can reside almost entirely within the interfacial region. In that
	way, the perturbation maximum is free to shift towards the less viscous
	fluid, i.e. into a locally more unstable environment. In contrast,
	for thin interfaces, the eigenfunction is forced to extend far into
	the viscous fluid, which leads to an overall stabilization. While
	the Hele-Shaw analysis also captures this `optimal' growth for intermediate
	interface thicknesses, the growth rates differ substantially from
	those obtained from the full Stokes equations. Compared to the Hele-Shaw
	results, growth rates obtained from the modified Brinkman equation
	are seen to yield better quantitative agreement with the Stokes results.},

	The key objective of the investigation is a detailed analysis of
	the flow structure at the foremost part of the front, where no previous
	high-resolution data were available. For the simulations, high-order
	numerical methods are used, based on spectral and spectral-element
	discretizations and compact finite differences. A three-dimensional
	simulation is conducted of a front spreading along a no-slip boundary
	at a Reynolds number of about 750. The simulation exhibits all features
	typically observed in experimental flows near the gravity-current
	head, including the lobe-and-cleft structure at the leading edge.
	The results reveal that the flow topology at the head differs from
	what has been assumed previously, in that the foremost point is not
	a stagnation point in a translating system. Rather, the stagnation
	point is located below and slightly behind the foremost point in
	the vicinity of the wall. The relevance of this finding for the mechanism
	behind the lobe-and-cleft instability is discussed. In order to explore
	the high-Reynolds-number regime, and to assess potential Reynolds-number
	effects, two-dimensional simulations are conducted for Reynolds numbers
	up to about 30 000, for both no-slip and slip (i.e. shear-stress
	free) boundaries. It is shown that although quantitative Reynolds-number
	effects persist over the whole range examined, no qualitative changes
	in the flow structure at the head can be observed. A comparison of
	the two-dimensional results with laboratory data and the three-dimensional
	simulation provides evidence that a two-dimensional model is able
	to capture essential features of the flow at the head. The simulations
	also show that for the free-slip case the shape of the head agrees
	closely with the classical inviscid theory of Benjamin.},

  abstract = {We develop two-relaxation-times Lattice Boltzmann schemes (TRT) with
	two relaxation functions for solving highly non-linear equations
	for groundwater modeling in d-dimensions, namely, the Richards equation
	for water content distribution in unsaturated flow and the associated
	transport equation for solute concentration , advected by the local
	Darcian water flux. The method is verified against the analytical
	solutions and the HYDRUS code where the TRT schemes behave more robustly
	for small diffusion coefficients and sharp infiltration profiles.
	The focus is on the stability and efficiency of two transport schemes.
	The first scheme conventionally prescribes C for diffusive flux equilibrium
	variable while conserving [theta]C. The second scheme prescribes
	[theta]C for both variables, expecting to retain the stable parameter
	areas and velocity amplitudes recently predicted by linear von Neumann
	stability analysis. We show that the first scheme reduces the stable
	diffusion range, e.g. from [Lambda]-/d to [theta][Lambda]-/d for
	simplest velocity sets, but it also modifies the linearized numerical
	diffusion, from -[Lambda]- U[alpha]U[beta] to -[theta][Lambda]-U[alpha]U[beta],
	giving rise to possible enhancement of stable velocity U2,max by
	a factor 1/[theta]. This analysis indicates that the first scheme
	is most efficient for infiltration into dry soil. When the product
	[Lambda]+[Lambda]- is kept constant, we find a good agreement between
	the attainable velocity and our predictions providing that [Lambda]-
	does not exceed [approximate]5. Otherwise, approaching two opposite
	stability limits, [Lambda]+ --> 0 when [Lambda]- --> [infinity] ,
	the stable velocity amplitude drastically falls for the two transport
	TRT schemes. At the same time, their BGK submodels [Lambda]+ = [Lambda]-
	may keep the optimal stability for diffusion-dominant problems but
	their boundary and bulk approximations are completely destroyed.
	The analysis presented here may serve as a starting point for construction
	of the suitable equilibrium transformations, based on the analytical
	stability argument and a proper parameter choice.},

  abstract = {''Viscous fingering'' generally refers to the onset and evolution
	of instabilities that occur in the displacementof fluids in porous
	materials. In most but not all cases, the mechanism the instability
	is intimately linked to of viscosity variations between phases or
	within a single phase containing a solute--hence the term ''viscous
	fingering.'' Shownin Figure 1 are three examplesof the complexand
	intriguing patterns that evolve as a result of this instability.
	Figure la showsthe fingering pattern that occurs whena moreviscous
	material is displaced by a less viscous one fully miscible with it
	by injecting from one corner and withdrawing from the diagonal corner
	of a horizontal square Hele-Shawcell; in this case the fluid consists
	of water injected into glycerine. Althoughthe mixture is fully miscible,
	it is obvious that less viscous material tends to penetrate and finger
	through the more viscous material. In this particular example, the
	patterns are driven by the difference in viscosity and influenced
	by the diffusive mixing between the fluids. In Figure lb, we show
	an example of the extreme patterns that are formedwhena less dense,
	less viscous fluid penetrates a more dense, more viscous fluid immiscible
	with it whena large Hele-Shaw cell is tipped into a vertical position.
	In this case both gravity and viscosity are important forces in driving
	the instability. Finally, in Figure lc we showthe pattern that results
	whena low-viscosity Newtonianfluid injected from a source penetrates
	a Hele-Shaw cell filled with a miscible but strongly non-Newtonian
	fluid. Wediscuss these examples in more detail below, but even though

	with the diffusive scaling. The analysis of this model directly leads
	to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, as opposed to the
	compressible Navier-Stokes equations obtained by the Chapman-Enskog
	analysis with convective scaling. We also apply the asymptotic analysis
	directly to the fully discrete LBE, as opposed to the usual practice
	of analyzing a continuous equation obtained through the Taylor-expansion
	of the LBE. This leads to a consistency analysis which provides order-by-order
	information about the numerical solution of the LBE. The asymptotic
	technique enables us to analyze the structure of the leading order
	errors and the accuracy of numerically derived quantities, such as
	vorticity. It also justifies the use of Richardson's extrapolation
	method. As an example, a two-dimensional Taylor-vortex flow is used
	to validate our analysis. The numerical results agree very well with
	our analytic predictions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a unified lattice Boltzmann method for flow
	in multiscale porous media. This model not only can simulate flow
	in porous systems of various length scales but also can simulate
	flow in porous systems where multiple length scales coexist. Simulations
	of unidirectional steady flow through homogeneous and heterogeneous
	porous media both recover Darcy?s law when the effects of inertial
	forces and Brinkman correction may be negligible. Direct use of this
	model on the usual computational nodes, with zero resistance on void
	spaces and infinite resistance on solid walls, gives results that
	agree well with analytical solutions. Simulations performed on a
	fractured porous system show that the method presented here gives
	very good overall permeability values for the whole fractured system.
	A series of simulations is performed on a simplified fractured system.
	The results indicate that, when the ratio of the permeability of
	the rock matrix to the fracture permeability calculated by the cubic
	law is less than 10-4, the effects of the rock matrix flow are negligible,
	and the discrete-fracture models that ignore such flow are plausible.
	When the ratio is larger than 10-4, the matrix flow has significant
	effects on the fractured system, and the assumption that the matrix
	is impermeable does not hold. Therefore, the use of the cubic law
	to calculate the fracture permeability may cause a significant error.
	It is also indicated that the larger the ratio of the width of the
	porous matrix to that of the fracture, the more significant is the
	error caused by using the cubic law.},

  title = {Lattice Boltzmann simulation of chemical dissolution in porous media},
  journal = {Phys. Rev. E},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {65},
  pages = {036318},
  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann model for simulating
	the transport and reaction of fluids in porous media. To simulate
	such a system, we account for the interaction of forced convection,
	molecular diffusion, and surface reaction. The problem is complicated
	by the evolution of the porous media geometry due to chemical reactions,
	which may significantly and continuously modify the hydrologic properties
	of the media. The particular application that motivates the present
	study is acid stimulation, a common technique used to increase production
	from petroleum reservoirs. This technique involves the injection
	of acid e.g., hydrochloric acid, HCl, acetic acid, HAc into the formation
	to dissolve minerals comprising the rock. As acid is injected, highly
	conductive channels or ``wormholes'' may be formed. The dissolution
	of carbonate rocks in 0.5M HCl and 0.5M HAc is simulated with the
	lattice Boltzmann model developed in this study. The dependence of
	dissolution process and the geometry of the final wormhole pattern
	on the acid type and the injection rate is studied. The results agree
	qualitatively with the experimental and theoretical analyses of others
	and substantiate the previous finding that there exists an optimal
	injection rate at which the wormhole is formed as well as the number
	of pore volumes of the injected fluid to break through is minimized.
	This study also confirms the experimentally observed phenomenon that
	the optimal injection rate decreases and the corresponding minimized
	number of pore volumes to break through increases as the acid is
	changed from HCl to HAc. Simulations suggest that the proposed lattice
	Boltzmann model may serve as an alternative reliable quantitative
	approach to study chemical dissolution in porous media.},

  pages = {1011-1029},
  abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of the concentric, two-phase flow of two immiscible
	fluids in a circular tube is studied when the viscosity ratio of
	the fluid in the annulus to that in the core of the tube, µ, is larger
	than or equal to unity. For these values of the viscosity ratio the
	perfect core-annular flow (CAF) is linearly unstable and it is necessary
	to keep the ratio of the thickness of the annulus to the radius of
	the tube small so that the solutions remain uniformly bounded. The
	simulations are based on a pseudospectral numerical method while
	special care has been taken in order to minimize as far as possible
	the effect of the boundary conditions imposed in the axial direction
	allowing for multiple waves of different lengths to develop and interact.
	The time integration originates with the analytical solution for
	the pressure driven, perfect CAF or the perfect CAF seeded with either
	the most unstable mode or random disturbances. Quite regular wave
	patterns are predicted in the first two cases, whereas multiple unstable
	modes grow and remain even after saturation of the instability in
	the last case. The resulting waves generally travel in the same direction
	and faster than the undisturbed interface, except for the case with
	µ=1 for which they are stationary with respect to it. Depending on
	parameter values, waves move with the same velocity or interact with
	each other exchanging their amplitudes or merge and split giving
	rise to either chaotic or organized solutions. For fluids of equal
	viscosities and densities (µ=rho=1) and for a Reynolds number, Re([equivalent]Lambdarho-hat1R-hat2W-hat0/mu-hat1)
	= 0.0275 and an inverse Weber number, W([equivalent]T-hat/(rho-hat1W-hat02R-hat2))
	= 145.4, both based on the properties of the inner fluid, the tube
	radius, R-hat2, and the average flow velocity, W-hat0, small amplitude
	waves are predicted. The increase of µ by almost two orders of magnitude
	does not affect their amplitudes, but increases their temporal period

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics of the concentric, two-phase flow of two immiscible
	fluids in a circular tube is studied. The viscosity of the fluid
	around the axis of symmetry of the tube is larger than the viscosity
	of the fluid that surrounds it and gravity acts against the applied
	pressure gradient. A pseudo-spectral numerical method is coupled
	with an implicit second order time-integration scheme to solve the
	complete mass and momentum conservation equations as an initial value
	problem. The simulations originate with the analytical solution for
	the pressure driven, steady, core-annular flow (CAF) in a tube. In
	order to replicate as closely as possible the experimental conditions
	reported by Bai, Chen and Joseph (1992), the volume fraction of each
	fluid in the tube and the total flow rate of both fluids are imposed.
	Furthermore, the length of the tube is taken to be as long as computationally
	possible in order to allow for multiple waves of different lengths
	to develop and interact as reported in the experiments and in earlier
	weakly nonlinear analyses. Having performed simulations of CAF for
	conditions under which the reported flow charts indicate that both
	phases retain their integrity but the original steady flow is unstable,
	it was found that indeed traveling waves develop with slightly sharper
	crests (pointing towards the annular fluid) than troughs, the so-called
	''bamboo waves.'' Despite the uneven interface, the flow in the core
	fluid closely resembles Poiseuille flow, but in the annular fluid
	small recirculation zones develop at the level of each crest. As
	the Reynolds number or the flow rate of the core fluid increase,
	the average wavelength and the amplitude of these waves decrease,
	whereas the holdup ratio of the core to the annular fluid approaches
	two. Their specific values for each examined case are in closer agreement
	with the experiments than in earlier theoretical reports. For large
	values of interfacial tension, waves with even different wavelength
	move with the same velocity, whereas for small values, they attain
	variable velocities and approach or repel each other but no wave
	merging or splitting is observed.},

	spurious algebraic coupling between the shear and energy modes of
	the linearized evolution operator is a defect universal to the energy-conserving
	Boltzmann models in two and three dimensions. This spurious mode
	coupling is highly anisotropic and may occur at small values of wave
	number k along certain directions, and it is a direct consequence
	of the following key features of the lattice Boltzmann equation:
	(1) its simple spatial-temporal dynamics, (2) the linearity of the
	relaxation modeling for collision operator, and (3) the energy-conservation
	constraint. To eliminate the spurious mode coupling, we propose a
	hybrid thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (HTLBE) in which the mass
	and momentum conservation equations are solved by using the multiple-relaxation-time
	model due to d?Humi{\`e}res, whereas the diffusion-advection equation
	for the temperature is solved separately by using finite-difference

	show that the hydrodynamic equations derived from the proposed HTLBE
	model include the equivalent effect of {\&}#947;=CP/CV in both the
	speed and attenuation of sound. Appropriate coupling between the
	energy and velocity field is introduced to attain correct acoustics
	in the model. The numerical stability of the HTLBE scheme is analyzed
	by solving the dispersion equation of the linearized collision operator.
	We find that the numerical stability of the lattice Boltzmann scheme
	improves drastically once the spurious mode coupling is removed.
	It is shown that the HTLBE scheme is far superior to the existing
	thermal LBE schemes in terms of numerical stability, flexibility,
	and possible generalization for complex fluids. We also present the

	The generalized hydrodynamics of the model is obtained by solving
	the dispersion equation of the linearized LBE either analytically

	are considered for the same oil-wet over water-wet surface ratio.
	A special technique to obtain oil-wet patches in a water-wet matrix

	described. The simulator properly incorporates imbibition-drainage
	events and flow through films as visualized in the experiments. Predictive
	efficiency of the simulator is tested by comparing the numerical
	results to the experimentally obtained phase distributions and saturations.
	In water/oil displacement, drainage and imbibition mechanisms occur
	according to the local wettability. Three-phase gas injection is
	dominated by drainage mechanisms. Oil flows through wetting films
	in the oil-wet regions and through spreading films on water in the
	water-wet regions. Both experiments and simulations show that the
	size and distribution of wettability heterogeneities strongly affect
	the microscopic and macroscopic behavior during gas injection processes.
	More specifically the effect of wettability heterogeneities on: (1)
	displacement mechanisms, (2) sweep efficiency, and (3) fluid distribution
	in three-phase gas injection is clearly demonstrated and successfully

	in the gap and thereby the observed viscosity. We show further that
	this rate of viscosity decrease is consistent with a gap-limited
	shear-induced diffusion process normal to the plane of shear, with
	the relevant diffusion coefficient being proportional to $a^2dot{gamma}$,
	where a is the particle radius and $dot{gamma}$ is the applied shear
	rate. Additional experiments also uncovered a new phenomenon - a
	short-term increase in the viscosity upon initial shearing of a suspension
	in a Couette device - which was attributed to the diffusive migration
	of particles across the width of the Couette gap and thus was used
	to infer values of the corresponding diffusion coefficient within
	the plane of shear parallel to gradients in fluid velocity. In the
	theoretical part we demonstrate that the particle migrations that
	led to these observed phenomena may be explained in terms of the
	irreversible interparticle interactions that occur in these suspensions.
	From simple arguments, these interactions are shown to lead to effective
	diffusivities both normal to the plane of shear and normal to the
	direction of fluid motion within the plane of shear whose estimated
	magnitudes are comparable with those that were inferred from the
	experimental measurements. Furthermore, these interactions should
	induce, within a shear flow, particle drifts from regions of high
	to low shear stress, which are estimated to be of sufficient intensity
	to account for the observed initial viscosity increase mentioned
	above.},

  abstract = {Autocatalytic reactions may propagate as solitary waves, namely, at
	a constant front velocity and with a stationary concentration profile,
	resulting from a balance between molecular diffusion and chemical
	reaction. When the reaction is exothermic, a thermal wave is linked
	to the chemical front. As the thermal diffusivity is nearly two orders
	of magnitude larger than the molecular one, the temperature profile
	spreads over length scales (mm) two orders of magnitude larger than
	the concentration one. Using an infrared camera, we measure the temperature
	profiles for a chlorite-tetrathionate autocatalytic reaction. The
	profiles are compared quantitatively to lattice Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
	(BGK) numerical simulations. Our analysis also accounts for the lack
	of observation of the thermal wave for the iodate arsenous acid reaction.},

  year = {1986},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {In the theory of shear-flow stability, the dominantapproach to investigating
	the stability of a parallel flow tT(y) is to superimposea small wavelike
	perturbation and determine its subsequent evolution with time. The
	ReynoldsnumberRe is often large in applications, so it is reasonable
	to employan inviscid theory as a first approximation.Giventhat Re
	>> 1, it is also reasonable to include nearly parallel flows, such
	as boundarylayers, in the theory by regarding ti(y) as the locally
	parallel velocity profile. The case of a disturbance that is periodic
	in space and time (i.e. a neutral mode)turns out to be surprisingly
	significant. Characteristic of this case is the presenceof a singularity
	occurring at that value ofy (the critical point Yc) where ~ = c,
	the phase speed of the perturbation. The resolution of this difficulty
	in the classical theory (see, for example, Lin 1955) consists restoring
	viscosity within a thin ''critical layer'' centered uponthe point
	Yc. One consequence is that a discontinuity in Reynoldsstress occurs
	across the critical layer, giving rise to the oscillations knownas
	TollmienSchlichting waves. This is a justly celebrated result, because
	in the absence of this effect the theory would predict, for example,
	that (contrary to observation) the Blasius boundarylayer is stable
	to infinitesimal perturbations. The same mechanismwas employed by
	Mil6s (1957) in a theory for the generation of water waves by wind.
	It would seem from these examples that the motivation for studying
	critical layers stems primarily from the search for instability mechanisms.
	However, muchof the current interest derives from the following,
	only loosely related, developments: (a) Recent analyses of critical
	layers demonstrate that their behavior, as described above, is substantially},

	governing three-phase flow, obtained using common empirical relative
	permeability models, exhibit complex wavespeeds for certain saturation
	values (elliptic regions) that result in unstable and non-unique
	solutions. We analyze a simple but physically realizable pore-scale
	model: a bundle of cylindrical capillary tubes, to investigate whether
	the presence of these elliptic regions is an artifact of using unphysical
	relative permeabilities. Without gravity, the model does not yield
	elliptic regions unless the most non-wetting phase is the most viscous
	and the most wetting phase is the least viscous. With gravity, the
	model yields elliptic regions for any combination of viscosities,
	and these regions occupy a significant fraction of the saturation
	space. We then present converged, stable numerical solutions for
	onedimensional flow, which include capillary pressure. These demonstrate
	that, even when capillary forces are small relative to viscous forces,
	they have a significant effect on solutions which cross or enter
	the elliptic region. We conclude that elliptic regions can occur
	for a physically realizable model of a porous medium, and that capillary
	pressure should be included explicitly in three-phase numerical simulators
	to obtain stable, physically meaningful solutions which reproduce
	the correct sequence of saturation changes. Key words: elliptic region,
	three-phase flow, stable solutions, capillary pressure, pore-scale.},

	viscosity. In a second part, we consider the coexistence of transient
	solid clusters coupled to regions with free flowing particles near
	the jamming transition. The fraction of particles in transient clusters
	is derived through the Landau-Ginzburg concepts for first-order phase
	transition with an order parameter corresponding to the proportion
	of âsolidâ contacts. A state equation for the fraction of particle-accessible
	volume is introduced to derive the average normal stresses and a
	constitutive law that relates the total shear stress to the shear
	rate. The analytical expression of the average normal stresses well
	accounts for numerical or experimental evaluation of the particle
	pressure and non-equilibrium osmotic pressure in a dense sheared
	suspension. Both the friction level between particles and the suspension
	dilatancy are shown to determine the singularity of the apparent
	shear viscosity and the flow stability near the jamming transition.
	The model further predicts a Newtonian behavior for a concentrated
	suspension of neutrally buoyant particles and no shear thinning behavior
	in relation with the shear liquefaction of transient solid clusters.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations of viscously
	unstable, miscible Hele-Shaw displacements are discussed. Quasisteady
	fingers are observed whose tip velocity increases with the Péclet
	number and the unfavourable viscosity ratio. These fingers are widest
	near the tip, and become progressively narrower towards the root.
	The film of resident fluid left behind on the wall decreases in thickness
	towards the finger tip. The simulations reveal the detailed mechanism
	by which the initial spanwise vorticity of the base flow, when perturbed,
	gives rise to the cross-gap vorticity that drives the fingering instability
	in the classical Darcy sense. Cross-sections at constant streamwise
	locations reveal the existence of a streamwise vorticity quadrupole
	along the length of the finger. This streamwise vorticity convects
	resident fluid from the wall towards the centre of the gap in the
	cross-gap symmetry plane of the finger, while it transports injected
	fluid laterally away from the finger centre within the mid-gap plane.
	In this way, it results in the emergence of a longitudinal, inner
	splitting phenomenon some distance behind the tip that has not been
	reported previously. This inner splitting mechanism, which leaves
	the tip largely intact, is fundamentally different from the familiar
	tip-splitting mechanism. Since the inner splitting owes its existence
	to the presence of streamwise vorticity and cross-gap velocity, it
	cannot be captured by gap-averaged equations. It is furthermore observed
	that the role of the Péclet number in miscible displacements differs
	in some ways from that of the capillary number in immiscible flows.
	Specifically, larger Péclet numbers result in wider fingers, while
	immiscible flows display narrower fingers for larger capillary numbers.
	Furthermore, while higher capillary numbers are known to promote
	tip-splitting, inner splitting is delayed for larger Péclet numbers.},

  abstract = {The selection of fully nonlinear extended oscillating states is analyzed
	in the context of one-dimensional nonlinear evolution equations with
	slowly spatially varying coefficients on a doubly infinite domain.
	Two types of synchronized structures referred to as steep and soft
	global modes are shown to exist. Steep global modes are characterized
	by the presence of a sharp stationary front at a marginally absolutely
	unstable station and their frequency is determined by the corresponding
	linear absolute frequency, as in Dee­Langer propagating fronts. Soft
	global modes exhibit slowly varying amplitude and wave number over
	the entire domain and their frequency is determined by the application
	of a saddle point condition to the local nonlinear dispersion relation.
	The two selection criteria are compared and shown to be mutually
	exclusive. The onset of global instability first gives rise to a
	steep global mode via a saddle-node bifurcation as soon as local
	linear absolute instability is reached somewhere in the medium. As
	a result, such self-sustained structures may be observed while the
	medium is still globally stable in a strictly linear approximation.
	Soft global modes only occur further above global onset and for sufficiently
	weak advection. The entire bifurcation scenario and state diagram
	are described in terms of three characteristic control parameters.
	The complete spatial structure of nonlinear global modes is analytically
	obtained in the framework of WKBJ approximations.},

	These are the first observations of such a phenomenon, which we call
	viscous compaction. At sufficiently high strain rates, the mixture

	a way that the power law rheology is recovered. The proposed LBM
	is applied to the study of power-law fluids in ordered sphere packings
	and stochastically reconstructed porous domains. A linear relation
	is found between the logarithm of the average velocity and the logarithm
	of the body force with a curve slope approximately equal to the inverse
	power-law index. The validity of the LBM for the flow of shear thinning
	fluids in porous media is also tested by comparing the average velocity
	with the well known semi-empirical ChristopherâMiddleman correlation.
	Good agreement is observed between the numerical results and the
	ChristopherâMiddleman correlation, indicating that the LBM combined
	with digital reconstruction constitutes a powerful tool for the study

  abstract = {We develop a model to describe the spreading of a reacting liquid

	on the case in which there is a density difference between the host
	reservoir fluid and the injected liquid. We examine reactions which
	lead to precipitation and a decrease in permeability or dissolution
	and an increase in permeability. In both cases, we assume the reaction
	is rapid compared to the speed of the flow. As the current spreads
	under gravity, we show that the interface between the injected fluid
	and the original fluid and also the reaction front, may be described
	by similarity solutions. The morphology of the two interfaces is
	controlled by two parameters: the permeability ratio across the reaction
	front, k, and the speed of the reaction front as a fraction of the
	interstitial speed, {\&}#955;. For a precipitation reaction, the
	reaction front lags some distance behind the leading edge of the
	region occupied by the injected fluid, and tends to terminate in
	a sharp vertical front. In contrast, for a dissolution reaction,
	the reaction front migrates as a gravity-driven finger along the
	base of the formation. In the case of large changes in permeability,
	k{\&}#955; > 1, this finger advances to the front of the flow, whereas
	for smaller increases in permeability, k{\&}#955; < 1, the finger
	is overrun with injected fluid which has already reacted and passed
	through the reaction front. We illustrate how these results are affected
	if the density of the reacting fluid decreases across the reaction
	zone. In the case of precipitation, small changes in density smooth
	out the leading edge of the reaction front, whereas large changes
	in density lead to slumping of the reaction front along the base
	of the current, and ultimately it extends to the nose of the flow.
	For dissolution reactions, the decrease in density across the reaction
	front causes the lateral extent of the finger to increase. As a result
	the critical value of the permeability ratio, k, for which the reaction
	front reaches the nose of the current decreases.},

	methods for imposing no-slip walls in lattice-Boltzmann schemes.
	By solving the lattice-BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) equations analytically
	in the case of plane Poiseuille flow, it is found that the volumetric
	approach by Chen et al. is first-order accurate in space, and the
	method of Bouzidi et al. second-order accurate in space. The latter
	method, however, is not mass conservative because of errors associated
	with interpolation of densities residing on grid nodes. Therefore,
	similar interpolations are applied to Chen?s volumetric scheme, which
	indeed improves the accuracy in the case of plane Poiseuille flow
	with boundaries parallel to the underlying grid. For skew boundaries,
	however, it is found that the accuracy remains first order. An alternative
	volumetric approach is proposed with a more accurate description
	of the geometrical surface. This scheme is demonstrated to be second-order
	accurate, even in the case of skew channels. The scheme is mass conservative
	in the propagation step because of its volumetric description, but
	still not in the collision step. However, the deviation in the mass
	is, in general, found to be small and proportional to the second-order
	terms in the standard BGK equilibrium distribution. Consequently,
	the scheme is a priori mass conservative for Stokes flow.},

	horizontally in covered thin layers of solution trigger hydrodynamic
	flows which can alter the concentration profile. We theoretically
	investigate the spatiotemporal evolution and asymptotic dynamics
	resulting from such an interplay between isothermal chemical reactions,
	diffusion, and buoyancy-driven convection. The studied model couples
	the reaction-diffusion-convection evolution equation for the concentration
	of an autocatalytic species to the incompressible Stokes equations
	ruling the evolution of the flow velocity in a two-dimensional geometry.
	The dimensionless parameter of the problem is a solutal Rayleigh
	number constructed upon the characteristic reaction-diffusion length
	scale. We show numerically that the asymptotic dynamics is one steady
	vortex surrounding, deforming, and accelerating the chemical front.
	This chemohydrodynamic structure propagating at a constant speed
	is quite different from the one obtained in the case of a pure hydrodynamic
	flow resulting from the contact between two solutions of different
	density or from the pure reaction-diffusion planar traveling front.
	The dynamics is symmetric with regard to the middle of the layer
	thickness for positive and negative Rayleigh numbers corresponding
	to products, respectively, lighter or heavier than the reactants.
	A parametric study shows that the intensity of the flow, the propagation
	speed, and the deformation of the front are increasing functions
	of the Rayleigh number and of the layer thickness. In particular,
	the asymptotic mixing length and reaction-diffusion-convection speed
	both scale as root Ra for Ra > 5. The velocity and concentration
	fields in the asymptotic dynamics are also found to exhibit self-similar
	properties with Ra. A comparison of the dynamics in the case of a
	monostable versus bistable kinetics is provided. Good agreement is
	obtained with experimental data on the speed of iodate-arsenous acid
	fronts propagating in horizontal capillaries. We furthermore compare

	of traveling chemical fronts in solution open to the air in the absence

  abstract = {Numerical models of fluid flow through porous media can be developed
	from either microscopic or macroscopic properties. The large-scale
	viewpoint is perhaps the most prevalent. Darcy's law relates the
	chief macroscopic parameters of interest--flow rate, permeability,
	viscosity, and pressure gradient--and may be invoked to solve for
	any of these parameters when the others are known. In practical situations,
	however, this solution may not be possible. Attention is then typically
	focused on the estimation of permeability, and numerous numerical
	methods based on knowledge of the microscopic pore-space geometry
	have been proposed.Because the intrinsic inhomogeneity of porous
	media makes the application of proper boundary conditions difficult,
	microscopic flow calculations have typically been achieved with idealized
	arrays of geometrically simple pores, throats, and cracks. I propose
	here an attractive alternative which can freely and accurately model
	fluid flow in grossly irregular geometries. This new method solves
	the Navier-Stokes equations numerically using the cellular-automaton
	fluid model introduced by Frisch, Hasslacher, and Pomeau. The cellular-automaton
	fluid is extraordinarily simple--particles of unit mass traveling
	with unit velocity reside on a triangular lattice and obey elementary
	collision rules--but is capable of modeling much of the rich complexity
	of real fluid flow. Cellular-automaton fluids are applicable to the
	study of porous media. In particular, numerical methods can be used
	to apply the appropriate boundary conditions, create a pressure gradient,
	and measure the permeability. Scale of the cellular-automaton lattice
	is an important issue; the linear dimension of a void region must
	be approximately twice the mean free path of a lattice gas particle.
	Finally, an example of flow in a 2-D porous medium demonstrates not
	only the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in a highly
	irregular geometry, but also numerical estimation of permeability
	and a verification of Darcy's law.},

	The vorticity-based point of view offers the advantage of clearly
	attributing the dominant flow characteristics to the effects of viscosity

	interactions among the above. Basic considerations regarding the
	vorticity field show that in an integral sense the coupling between
	viscosity and gravity vorticity is predominantly one way in nature,

	an explanation for the formation of the gravity tongue in terms of
	a focusing mechanism, which results from the combined action of the
	unfavourable viscosity gradient and the potential flow field generated
	by the interaction of the gravitational vorticity with the horizontal
	boundaries. This potential velocity field locally enhances the uniform
	global displacement velocity near the upper boundary, and thereby
	amplifies the viscous fingering instability along this section of
	the interface. In some parameter ranges, the gravity tongue exhibits
	interesting interactions with the viscous fingers next to it, such

  abstract = { ABSTRACT The two-phase flow in settling vessels with walls that are
	inclined to the vertical is investigated. By neglecting inertial
	effects and the viscosity of the suspension i t is shown that the
	particle concentration remains constant on kinematic-wave fronts.
	The wave fronts are horizontal and propagate in a quasi-one-dimensional
	manner, but are imbedded in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional
	basic flow which, in turn, depends on the waves via the boundary
	conditions. Concentration discontinuities (interfaces) are described
	by kinematic-shock theory. The kinematic shocks are shown to be horizontal,
	with the possible exception of discontinuities that separate the
	suspension from the sediment.At downward-facing inclined walls conservation
	of mass enforces the existence of a boundary-layer flow with relatively
	large velocity. As G&sol;R2&rarr;&infin; and G&sol;R4&rarr; 0, where
	G and R are respectively a sedimentation Grashof number and a sedimentation
	Reynolds number, the entrainment of suspended particles into the
	boundary-layer flow of clear liquid is negligibly small. This provides
	an appropriate boundary condi- tion for the basic flow of the suspension.
	Thus, in the double limit considered, a kine- matic theory suffices
	to determine the convective flow of the suspension due to the presence
	of inclined walls.As an example batch sedimentation in vessels with
	inclined plane or conical walls is investigated. The settling process
	is terminated after a time that can be considerably smaller than
	the time required in a vertical vessel under the same conditions.Depending
	on the initial particle concentration, there are centred kinematic
	waves that are linked to a continuous increase of the particle concentration
	in the suspension. In an appendix, the flow in the boundary layer
	at a downward facing, inclined wall is investigated. With G&sol;R2&rarr;&infin;
	and G&sol;R4&rarr; 0, the boundary layer consists of an inviscid
	particle-free main part, a viscous sublayer at the wall, and a free
	shear sublayer at the liquid&sol;particle interface. },

	that miscible core-annular flows with the more viscous fluid in the

	with the less viscous fluid in the core exhibit absolute instability
	at high viscosity ratios, over a limited range of core radii. Nonlinear

	the macroscopic scale, provided that the Reynolds number is sufficiently

	of fluids in Hele-Shaw cells were conducted under microgravity conditions.
	Extensive direct numerical simulations allowed to investigate the
	sensitivity of the displacement process to the variation of values
	of the main governing parameters. Validation of the code was performed
	by comparing the results of model problems simulations with experiments
	and with the existing solutions published in literature. Numerical
	simulations allowed to explain new experimental results on the pear
	shape of fingers and periodical separation of their tip elements
	from the main body of displacing fluid. These separated blobs of
	less viscous fluid move much faster than the mean flow of the displaced
	viscous fluid. The results of numerical simulations processed on
	the basis of dimensions analysis allow to introduce parameters characterizing
	the quality of displacement and the mixing flux induced by instability.
	Functional forms describing additional mixing induced by displacement
	instability were developed. The influence of inhomogeneity of porous
	matrix on displacement instability is being investigated. The modified
	Hele-Shaw cell containing regular and randomized obstacles is used
	to study the effect of inhomogeneity on displacement instability.
	The result of numerical simulations as well as physical experiment

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years a new paradigm has emerged in linear stability
	theory due to the recognition of the importance of non-normality
	in the Orr{\&}ndash;Sommerfeld equation as derived from the method
	of normal modes. For single-fluid flows it has been shown that it
	is possible for the kinetic energy of certain stable mode combinations
	to grow transiently before decaying to zero. We look again at the
	linear stability of two-fluid plane Poiseuille flow in two dimensions,
	concentrating on transient growth and its dependence on the viscosity
	and depth ratio. The procedure is to solve the stability equations
	numerically and consider disturbances defined as a sum of the least
	stable eigenmodes (not just the least stable interfacial mode). It
	is found that the variational method used to find maximum growth
	cannot be based upon the kinetic energy of the flow only and that
	interface deflection must be included in the formulation. We show
	which modes are necessary for inclusion in the disturbance expression
	and find that the interfacial mode does not make a significant contribution
	to possible energy growth. We examine the magnitude of maximum growth
	and the nature of the disturbances that lead to this growth. The
	linear energy rate equation shows that at moderate Reynolds numbers
	the mechanism responsible for the largest two-fluid growth is transfer
	of energy from the basic flow via the Reynolds stresses. The energy

  abstract = {The recent advances in 3-D imaging of porous structures have generated
	a tremendous interest in the simulation of complex single and two-phase
	flows. Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) schemes present a powerful tool to
	solve the flow field directly from the binarized 3-D images. However,
	as viscosity often plays an important role, the LB scheme should
	correctly treat viscosity effects. This is the case using a LB scheme
	with two relaxation times (TRT) unlike the broadly used, the single-relaxation
	rate, BGK, where the velocity of the modeled fluid does not vary
	as the inverse of the viscosity applying the bounce-back (no-slip)
	boundary rule. The aim of this work is to apply the LB-TRT approach
	to different types of porous media (straight channels, 2-D model
	porous media, sandstone) to solve for the flow field and to evaluate
	the approach in terms of parameter dependence, error and convergence
	time on the basis of permeability. We show that the variation of
	permeability with the free relaxation parameter &#923; of the TRT
	scheme depends on the heterogeneity of the sample and on the numerical
	resolution. The convergence time depends on the applied viscosity
	and the parameter standing for the speed of sound, thus the computation
	time can be reduced by choosing appropriate values of those parameters.
	Two approaches to calculate permeability (Darcy's law and viscous
	energy dissipation) are proposed and investigated. We recommend to
	use Darcy's law, as dependence on &#923; is less important. Periodic
	(in the presence of a driving body force) and pressure boundary conditions

	medium. The former is necessary when permeability changes fast at
	a relatively small scale, and in general, it is a more complete description
	of flow in a heterogeneous medium. Lattice-gas methods are ideally
	suited to simulate such flows. Simulations using a lattice BGK method
	and a smallfluctuation approach are described for an isotropic, exponentially
	decaying correlation function of the permeability field. The analytical
	results contain the additional parameter Kl/l2 (where Kl and l are
	the typical permeability and velocity variation length, respectively),
	the sensitivity to which was studied. As expected, the contribution
	of the Brinkman effect is insignificant for typical field values
	of this parameter, in which case, the classical results are recovered.
	At larger values, for example, for heterogeneous media of a small
	correlation length, and possibly in laboratory applications, the
	Brinkman correction leads to a decrease in macrodispersivity, reflecting
	the smoothing effect of the Brinkman correction on the velocity field.
	Nonetheless, for practical values of the parameters, this reduction
	is no larger than 50\% of the classical expression. The small fluctuation
	theory was found to be in good agreement with the simulations, provided
	that it was consistently applied (namely, by not mixing first-order
	with second-order expansions). The results also show that lattice-gas

	one of lower density in a horizontal capillary tube is studied by
	means of Stokes flow simulations. Both axisymmetric and three-dimensional
	simulations are conducted at Péclet numbers up to 104, in order to
	resolve discrepancies between earlier simulations by [C.Y. Chen,

	of [P. Petitjeans, T. Maxworthy, Miscible displacements in capillary
	tubes. Part 1. Experiments, J. Fluid Mech. 326 (1996) 37] and [J.
	Kuang, T. Maxworthy, P. Petitjeans, Miscible displacements between
	silicone oils in capillary tubes, Eur. J. Mech. B Fluids 22 (2003)
	271-277]. An initial set of simulations addresses the influence of
	different viscosity-concentration relations on the quasisteady finger
	tip velocity. The results indicate that steeper relations generally
	result in a higher tip velocity. However, the effect is too small
	to explain the above discrepancies. Further simulations show that
	a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient results in a slight
	reduction of the tip velocity at moderate Pe, but again the effect
	is too small to fully account for the observed differences. Three-dimensional
	simulations that include gravitational forces yield a much more significant
	effect. Consistent with the experiments of [P. Petitjeans, T. Maxworthy,
	Miscible displacements in capillary tubes. Part 1. Experiments, J.
	Fluid Mech. 326 (1996) 37], at moderate Pe the tip slows down as
	the gravity parameter increases, an effect that becomes more pronounced
	as Pe decreases. However, the three-dimensional simulations do not
	produce the longitudinal splitting phenomenon observed by [P. Petitjeans,
	T. Maxworthy, Miscible displacements in capillary tubes. Part 1.
	Experiments, J. Fluid Mech. 326 (1996) 37]. In order to check for
	the existence of gravitational instabilities that might cause such
	a splitting, additional two-dimensional simulations are conducted
	in cross-sections of the tube. A comparison of these two-dimensional
	results with corresponding three-dimensional simulations demonstrates
	that for a wide range of parameters the evolution of the trailing
	finger sections is governed by a two-dimensional balance between
	gravitational and viscous forces. However, a gravitational instability
	along the lines suggested by [P. Petitjeans, T. Maxworthy, Miscible
	displacements in capillary tubes. Part 1. Experiments, J. Fluid Mech.
	326 (1996) 37] was not observed. On the other hand, for some parameter
	combinations the evolution of a 'dimple' is observed on the lower
	side of the finger, and close to its tip. This dimple may signal
	the evolution of a splitting phenomenon after long times, which are
	beyond the reach of the current simulations. Taken together, the
	two- and three-dimensional simulations suggest that the splitting
	phenomenon observed by [P. Petitjeans, T. Maxworthy, Miscible displacements
	in capillary tubes. Part 1. Experiments, J. Fluid Mech. 326 (1996)
	37] likely is caused by the gravity-induced modification of the flow
	around the tip of the finger, rather than by a gravitational instability
	per se.},

	some physical insights into the flow of power-law and Bingham fluids.
	Therefore, this work is divided into three parts: (1) review of the
	laboratory and theoretical research on non-Newtonian flow, (2) development
	of new numerical and analytical solutions, (3) theoretical studies
	of transient flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media, and (4)
	demonstration of applying a new method of well test analysis and
	displacement efficiency evaluation to field problems.},

	multigrid techniques and parallelization allow us to solve the Stokes
	and advection-diffusion equations on large meshes with several millions

	a digitized Fontainebleau sandstone sample. We use the calculated
	velocity to simulate pore-scale solute transport and diffusion. From
	this, we are able to calculate the a priori emergent macroscopic
	hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of the porous medium for a given
	molecular diffusion Dm of the solute species. By performing this
	calculation at a range of flow rates, we can correctly predict all
	of the observed flow regimes from diffusion dominated to convection

	a passive tracer. By monitoring the displacement front at successive
	time intervals (for example, using a tomographic method), the permeability
	can be directly obtained from the solution of a nonlinear boundary-value
	problem. Well posedness requires knowledge of the pressure profile
	or the permeability at no-flow boundaries. The method is tested using
	synthetic data in two dimensions (2D) (and some 3D) geometries for
	a variety of heterogeneous fields and found to work well when the
	permeability contrast is not too large. However, it is sensitive
	to sharp variations in permeability. In the latter case, a modified
	approach based on the successive injection in both directions and
	the use of an optimization technique leads to improved estimates.
	The sensitivity to measurement errors is analyzed. An important feature
	of the direct method is that it also applies to anisotropic porous
	media. When the principal axes of anisotropy are known, a suitable
